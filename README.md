# Rest Application

Rest Application is a Java-based web application that provides RESTful APIs for managing client information.

## Description

This project aims to create a RESTful web application using Java and Spring Boot framework. It provides APIs for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client data. The application uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence and follows RESTful API design principles for resource management.

## Installation

To run the Rest Application locally, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven
- MySQL or any other compatible relational database

Follow these steps to install and run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the database configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database credentials.
3. Build the application using Maven: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the Rest Application is up and running, you can use any API client (such as Postman) to interact with the APIs. Here are some examples of API endpoints that you can use:

- `GET /clientes`: Get all clients.
- `GET /clientes/{id}`: Get a client by ID.
- `POST /clientes`: Create a new client.
- `PUT /clientes/{id}`: Update a client by ID.
- `DELETE /clientes/{id}`: Delete a client by ID.

Make sure to include the appropriate request body and headers when making API requests, as per the API documentation.
